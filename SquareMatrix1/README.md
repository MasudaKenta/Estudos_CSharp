NOME: Square Matrix 1 Número: 1435
Write a program that read an integer number N (0 ≤ N ≤ 100) that correspond to the order of a Bidimentional array of integers, and build the Array according to the above example.
<br>
<h3><b>Input</b></h3>
The input consists of several integers numbers, one per line, corresponding to orders from arrays to be built. The end of input is indicated by zero (0).
<br>
<h3><b>Output</b></h3>
For each integer number of input, print the corresponding array according to the example. (the values ​​of the arrays must be formatted in a field of size 3 right justified and separated by a space. None space must be printed after the last character of each row of the array. A blank line must be printed after each array.
